Repository for all my learning stage projects

## Calculator - DONE

Yet another Python Calculator

> Might update when I learn some GUI framework

#### Bugs-to-fix:

- User can input letters as function parameters which break everything

## rpg-battle - NOT YET

Yet another rpg-like battle system

> Might make it more interactive in the future

## game--pong

Yet another Pong simulator

### Bugs

- Paddles can go beyond Y coordinates
- Bounce sound not working (using winsound)
- Can only move paddles one at a time (might be a Turtle module limitation)
- Initial paddle movement (when holding down key) takes a while to get going
